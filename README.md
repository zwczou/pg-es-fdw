PostgreSQL Elasticsearch foreign data wrapper
=============================================

The general idea is to store a canonical version of application data
in PostgreSQL and send only partial data to Elasticsearch. Most applications
handle this with complicated event systems. Foreign data wrapper allows
PostgreSQL to communicate with Elasticsearch directly.

With a couple of triggers, all relevant changes to application data will
automatically propagate to Elasticsearch.

Installation
------------

Prerequisities: python >=2.7 <3, any elasticsearch, postgres >=9.2

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kozea/Multicorn /tmp/multicorn
cd $_
git checkout v1.1.0 # newer 1.2.0 does not compile on OS X
make install

git clone https://github.com/Mikulas/pg-es-fdw /tmp/pg-es-fdw
cd $_
python setup.py install
```

Optionally you may install multicorn as `postgresql-9.4-python-multicorn` apt package.
(The python3 variant probably works as well but it was not tested.)

Usage
-----

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION multicorn;

CREATE SERVER multicorn_es FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER multicorn
OPTIONS (
  wrapper 'dite.ElasticsearchFDW'
);

CREATE TABLE articles (
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    title text NOT NULL,
    content text NOT NULL,
    created_at timestamp
);

CREATE FOREIGN TABLE articles_es (
    id bigint,
    title text,
    content text
) SERVER multicorn_es OPTIONS (host '127.0.0.1', port '9200', node 'test', index 'articles', primary_key 'id');



CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION index_article() RETURNS trigger AS $def$
	BEGIN
		INSERT INTO articles_es (id, title, content) VALUES
			(NEW.id, NEW.title, NEW.content);
		RETURN NEW;
	END;
$def$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION reindex_article() RETURNS trigger AS $def$
	BEGIN
		UPDATE articles_es SET
			title = NEW.title,
			content = NEW.content
		WHERE id = NEW.id;
		RETURN NEW;
	END;
$def$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION delete_article() RETURNS trigger AS $def$
	BEGIN
		DELETE FROM articles_es a WHERE a.id = OLD.id;
		RETURN OLD;
	END;
$def$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;


CREATE TRIGGER es_insert_article
    AFTER INSERT ON articles
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE index_article();

CREATE TRIGGER es_update_article
    AFTER UPDATE OF title, content ON articles
    FOR EACH ROW
    WHEN (OLD.* IS DISTINCT FROM NEW.*)
    EXECUTE PROCEDURE reindex_article();

CREATE TRIGGER es_delete_article
	BEFORE DELETE ON articles
	FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE delete_article();

```

Caveats
-------

Elasticsearch does not support transactions, so the elasticsearch index
is not guaranteed to be synchronized with the canonical version in PostgreSQL.
Unfortunatelly this is the case even for serializable isolation level transactions.
It would however be possible to check against Elasticsearch version field and locking.

Rollback is currently not supported.
